# Music Mania

Music is a wonderful resource for visually impaired children.Exposure to it enhances a childâ€™s natural ability to decode sounds and words.**Music Mania** is a simple game where kids can play music using the keyboard keys.Pressing any key produces a musical sound giving a sense of accomplishment and instilling happiness in the child. This will not only improve their motor skills but is also a fundamentsl step towards digital literacy.The initial step of understanding the location of different keys on the keyboard will be accomplished by this game.

**This game is being developed as a [Google Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) project under the [Inclusive Design Institute](https://inclusivedesign.ca/).**
